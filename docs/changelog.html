<div class="section" id="interventions-phase-i">
<h2>0.8 (Interventions Phase I)<a class="headerlink" href="#interventions-phase-i" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Release implementing the first part of the interventions interface, allowing
data editors to note Derrida’s annotation-style interventions on digital editions
of his library works.</p>
<div class="section" id="access">
<h3>Access<a class="headerlink" href="#access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a record editor, I can only view digitized materials from Derrida’s library when I am logged in so that copyrighted materials are not exposed to the general public.</li>
<li>As a logged in record editor, I should be able to create an intervention record so that I can document Derrida’s interventions in the works in his library.</li>
<li>As a logged in record editor, I should be able to view, edit, and delete all intervention records (no matter who created them) so that I can manage all documented interventions in Derrida’s library.</li>
<li>Logged in record editors or anyone with greater permissions should be able to view the books; anonymous users or logged in users without those permissions should not.</li>
<li>As an admin, I want to see the history of all edits to an intervention, including edits made via the canvas image interface, so that I can track who has contributed and made changes to the data.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="books">
<h3>Books<a class="headerlink" href="#books" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a record editor, when I’m editing a book record I want to see a list of all the interventions (annotations and insertions) associated with that book so that I can review and update interventions by related book.</li>
<li>As a record editor, when I’m editing a book I want to be able to view the associated digitized materials so I can see pictures of the book, annotations, insertions, and other relevant markings.</li>
<li>As a record editor, I want to see an indicator if a library instance has a digital edition associated and be able to sort on the presence of a digital edition so that I can easily get to volumes that have been digitized.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="citations">
<h3>Citations<a class="headerlink" href="#citations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a record editor, I want to be able to associate a citation with one or more interventions (annotations or insertions) so that I can identify instances where citations relate in an explicit way to interventions (for example, a passage is quoted in the Derrida text and underlined in the book from the library).</li>
<li>As a record editor, when editing this field in the Django admin, I want it to automatically filter to only those intervetions associated with the digital edition of the book (i.e. if a reference is set to BookA, only interventions associated with BookA show up).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interventions">
<h3>Interventions<a class="headerlink" href="#interventions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As an intervention data editor, I want the option of leaving all fields blank so that I can accurately describe non-verbal interventions or interventions that don’t relate to anchor text.</li>
<li>As an intervention data editor, I want to be able to add and edit the color if the ink type is “pen,” so that I can see if there are patterns in Derrida’s pen usage and whether he revisited the same text.</li>
<li>As an interventions data editor, I want to select non-verbal interventions (underlining, circling, etc.) on a page image so I can transcribe anchor text and document the intervention and where it occurs.</li>
<li>As an intervention data editor, I want to edit any of the text fields (transcription, translation, anchor text, tags etc) so that I can correct mistakes or make updates.</li>
<li>As an intervention data editor, I want to select verbal interventions on a page image and enter a transcription of the text so I can document the intervention and where it occurs.</li>
<li>As a data editor, I want to see an indicator on the Django admin site that shows whether an intervention is verbal or non-verbal, so I can more easily distinguish these important categories.</li>
<li>As an intervention data editor, I would like to be able to tag part or all of transcribed verbal intervention text as “uncertain.”</li>
<li>As an intervention data editor, I would like to be able to tag a verbal intervention as “illegible” so that I can clearly indicate when the text is unreadable.</li>
<li>As an interventions data editor, I want the option to enter a translation of verbal intervention text so that I can provide an English version when the original is in another language.</li>
<li>As an interventions data editor, I want to associate an intervention with the person who wrote it so that I can document the author when that information is known; I want “Derrida, Jacques” to be the default intervention author, and I want to be able to add or edit this information.</li>
<li>As an interventions data editor, I want to document the language of anchor text and annotation text so that I can track use of languages across interventions.</li>
<li>As an intervention data editor, I want to transcribe the anchor text (if there is any) for an annotation so I can document the text the intervener is referencing.</li>
<li>As an intervention data editor, I want to tag interventions from a pre-defined list so that I can describe the characteristics and type of intervention.</li>
<li>As a record editor I want to view, edit, and create tags to describe and annotations and insertions so that I can manage the tags available for interventions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>0.7<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

be listed in Django admin.</li>

and squash book migrations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bibliographic-enhancements">
<h2>0.6 Bibliographic Enhancements<a class="headerlink" href="#bibliographic-enhancements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Refactor books into works and instances; update citation admin functionality to support capturing citation anchor text with minimal formatting.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a record editor, I want to be able to add new or edit citation anchor text in both French and English.</li>
<li>As an data editor, I want to be able to add the anchor text of a citation along with basic markdown formatting (bold, italic) so that I can accurately capture Derrida’s citations.</li>
<li>As a record editor, I want to add and edit bibliographic data for works and instances of works so I can document shared metadata and group different copies and editions of the same work.</li>
<li>As a record editor, I want to document the print date for a book, including month and year when available, so that I can check if a given copy was available to Derrida when he was writing a text.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bio-bibliographical-admin-interface">
<h2>0.5 Bio/Bibliographical Admin interface<a class="headerlink" href="#bio-bibliographical-admin-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

the database and customized Django admin interface for data import
and management of biographical and bibliographic data.</p>
<p>Features are expressed as user stories as written by the development and
project teams.</p>
<div class="section" id="book-metadata">
<h3>Book Metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#book-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As a record editor, I want to add a new or edit an existing book so that I can document the publication data, annotation data, citations, and other relevant details.</li>
<li>As a record editor, I want to add new data in or edit the following fields so that I can document them in a standard way. See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/derrida-django/issues/2">#2</a>.</li>
<li>As a record editor, I want to be able to add a work’s original date, its copyright date, and its date d’impression (date of publication).</li>
